# PowerPoint WebPresenter
Facilitates presentation of PowerPoint (pptx and ppt) files over a Local Area Network.

Requires PowerPoint 2016 to be installed. May work with older versions, but this is untested.

Important limitation: Slides are presented as static images, so video, audio, transitions and animations and will not be visible
